# responsePatterns

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Some survey participants tend to respond carelessly which complicates data analysis. This package provides functions that make it easier to explore responses and identify those that may be problematic. Two core functions of this package provide two approaches to the problem of careless responses detection:  
 - **`rp.acors`** is based on the auto-correlation approach that allows for a probabilistic detection of repetitive patterns a in survey data. This function calculates auto-correlation coefficients for all lags up to the value defined by the max.lag parameter for each observation (respondent). Subsequently, it assigns a percentile value to each observation (respondent) based either on the highest absolute auto-correlation or the sum of absolute auto-correlations.  
 - **`rp.patterns`** takes a more mechanistic approach. It searches for repetitive patterns in the data using an iterative algorithm. Patterns are defined based on the data: if a sequence of values occurs more than once within an observation, it is considered a repetition. The algorithm counts the number of repetitions for each pattern length and then weighs this sum by the length of the pattern (longer patterns are assigned higher weight). The total score for each respondent is determined as the sum of these pattern length-specific scores and is standardized to take a value between 0 and 1.

Both approaches yield scores that serve as estimates of how problematic the observations potentially are. However, no conclusions should be made without a closer inspection of the problematic responses. Any decision about removing or downweighing an observation should be based on visual inspection of the responses, the specifics of the instrument used to collect the data, familiarity with the whole data set and the context of the data collection process.

Both core functions return an S4 object of class ResponsePatterns. The package offers several utility functions that allow to inspect to results of the analysis more closely:  
- **`rp.summary`** (or, simply, **`summary`**) provides an overview of the object;  
- **`rp.indices`** extracts indices and, optionally, coefficients, from the object;  
- **`rp.select`** reorders observations and selects those equal of above a defined percentile;  
- **`rp.save2csv`** exports indices and, optionally, coefficients and data into a CSV file;  
- **`rp.hist`** plots a histogram of the main "suspicion" index (see documentation for further details);  
- **`rp.plot`** plots an individual response for easier visual inspection and allows for graphical formatting that eases this inspection;  
- **`rp.plots2pdf`** exports a collection of individual plots into a PDF file.

The rationale for response pattern analysis is described in

## Installation
<!--
You can install the released version of responsePatterns from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("responsePatterns")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
-->
You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("trihacek/responsePatterns")
```

## Examples

The package comes with an *N* = 100 data set (**`rp.simdata`**) that contains an ID variable (called "optional_ID") and simulated responses to 20 items rated on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 to 5. We use this data set to demonstrate the functionality of the package.

First, create a ResponsePatterns object that contains information about the potentially problematic patterns.

```{r, tidy=TRUE}
library(responsePatterns)
#Use auto-correlation screening to find patterns in the data
rp1 <- rp.acors(rp.simdata, max.lag=5, id.var="optional_ID")
#Alternatively, use an iterative mechanistic method fo pattern detection
rp2 <- rp.patterns(rp.simdata, id.var="optional_ID")
#The analysis may take some time for longer data sets...

#Display a summary of the analysis
rp.summary(rp1)

```

Second, select observations above the 90th (or any other) percentile for closer examination and extract (or export) the indices.

```{r, tidy=TRUE}
#Select observations above X percentile
rp.selected <- rp.select(rp1, percentile=90)

#Extract indices
indices <- rp.indices(rp1, include.coefs=FALSE)
head(indices)
```

Or export them into a CVS file for further processing.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

#Or export them into a CVS file for further processing
rp.save2csv(rp1) 

#You may also plot a histogram of the "suspicion" score to get an idea of 
#what your data set looks like overall
rp.hist(rp1)

```

Third, plot individual responses that warrant closer inspection.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Select the observation (see IMG 1)
rp.plot(rp.selected, obs=1)

#Optionally, color the items based on their valence (or any other criterion) and 
#display pagination of the questionnaire (see IMG 2)
rp.plot(rp.selected, obs=1, groups=list(c(1:10),c(11:20)), page.breaks=c(5,10,15))

#You may also export a collection of plot into a PDF file (utilizing the same 
#graphical arguments as the single rp.plot function)
rp.plots2pdf(rp.selected, groups=list(c(1:10),c(11:20)), page.breaks=c(5,10,15))

```

You may also use pipelines to streamline the process if you like.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(magrittr)

rp1 %>% rp.select(percentile=90) %>% rp.indices()

rp2 %>% rp.select(percentile=80) %>% rp.plots2pdf()

```
