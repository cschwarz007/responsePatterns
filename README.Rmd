# responsePatterns

<!-- badges: start -->

Some survey respondents tend to respond carelessly which complicates data analysis. This package provides functions that make it easier to explore resposes and identify those that may be problematic. Two core functions of this package provide two approaches to the problem of careless responses detection:
- *rp.acors()* is based on the auto-correlation approach that allows for a probabilistic detection of repetitive patterns a in survey data. This function calculates auto-correlation coefficients for all lags up to the value defined by the max.lag parameter for each observation (respondent). Subsequently, it assigns a percentile value to each observation (respondent) based either on the highest absolute auto-correlation or the sum of absolute auto-correlations.
- *rp.patterns()* takes a more mechanistic approach. It searches for repetitive patterns in the data using an iterative algorithm. Patterns are defined based on the data: if a sequence of values occurs more than once within an observation, it is considered a repetition. The algorithm counts the number of repetitions for each pattern length and then weighs this sum by the length of the pattern (longer patterns are assigned higher weight). The total score for each respondent is determined as the sum of these pattern length-specific scores and is standardized to take a value between 0 and 1.

Both approaches yield scores that serve as estimates of how problematic the observations potentially are. However, no conclusions should be made without a closer inspection of the problematic responses. Any decision about removing or downweighing an observation should be based on visual inspection of the responses, the specifics of the instrument used to collect the data, familiarity with the whole data set and the context of the data collection process.

Both core functions return an S4 oblect of class ResponsePatterns. The package offers several utility functions that allow to inspect to results of the analysis more closely:
- *summary* provides an overview of the object;
- *rp.indices* extracts indices and, optionally, coefficients, from the object;
- *rp.select* reorders observations and selects those equal of above a defined percentile;
- *rp.save2csv* exports indices and, optionally, coefficients and data into a CSV file;
- *rp.hist* plots a histogram of the main "suspicion" index (see documentation for further details);
- *rp.plot* plots an individual response for easier visual inspection and allows for graphical formatting that eases this inspection;
- *rp.plots2pdf* exports a collection of individual plots into a PDF file.

The package comes with an N = 100 data set (*rp.simdata*) that contains an ID variable (called "optional_ID") and simulated responses to 20 items. We use this data set to demonstrate the functionality of the package.

## Installation

You can install the released version of responsePatterns from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("responsePatterns")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("trihacek/responsePatterns")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(responsePatterns)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
